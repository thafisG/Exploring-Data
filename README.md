# Exploring-Data 👩🏻‍💻

## This notebook is an exercise in the Introduction to Machine Learning

### 1) Importing libraries: 
- learntools.core: being used to configure and provide code selection functionality in an interactive learning environment
- datetime: used for data
- pandas: provides powerful data structures and tools for working with data
- sklearn.model_selection: This library is used to split datasets into training and testing sets, as was done with the train_test_split function

- sklearn.tree: This library was used to import a class

- DecisionTreeRegressor: used to create a decision tree-based regression model.

- sklearn.model_selection: This library was used to import the train_test_split function, which is used to split the data into training and validation sets.

### 2) A model (DecisionTreeRegressor) was created and the logo was adjusted

### 3) The model was fit to the training data using the fit() method.

### 4) The predict() method was used to perform the optimization.
